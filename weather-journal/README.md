# Weather Journal App

## Description

The Weather Journal App allows users to enter a US zip code and their feelings about the day. The app fetches the current weather data for the entered zip code from the OpenWeatherMap API, sends this data along with the current date and the user's feelings to the local server, and updates the user interface to display the information.

## Features

- **Input Fields:** Users can enter a zip code and their feelings.
- **Fetch Weather Data:** Retrieves the current temperature from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the entered zip code.
- **Dynamic UI Update:** Displays the date, temperature, and user's feelings on the webpage.
- **Server Interaction:** Uses Node.js and Express to handle POST and GET requests, storing and retrieving project data.

3. **Obtain OpenWeatherMap API Key:**

   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get a free API key.

3. **Generate Weather Report:**

   - The app will fetch the current weather data for the entered zip code from the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - It will then send this data, along with the current date and your feelings, to the server via a POST request.
