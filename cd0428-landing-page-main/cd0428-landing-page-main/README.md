## Introduction

The Landing Page project aims to transform a static webpage into an interactive one by dynamically building the navigation menu, enabling smooth scrolling, and highlighting sections based on the user's scroll position. This project demonstrates skills in JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:

```
project-folder/
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── index.html
├── js/
│   └── app.js
└── README.md
```

- `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains the CSS styling for the project.
- `js/app.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for interactivity.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Instructions

The starter project includes HTML and CSS files to display a static version of the Landing Page. Your task is to convert this project from a static page to an interactive one. Most of your work will be done in the JavaScript file (`js/app.js`).

To get started, open `js/app.js` and begin implementing the required functionality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu is built dynamically based on the sections present in the HTML.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking on a navigation item scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: The section in the viewport is highlighted, and the corresponding navigation link is also highlighted.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout and navigation are responsive across different devices (desktop, tablet, and phone).

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/landing-page-project.git
    ```

2. **Open the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd landing-page-project
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a browser** to view the project.

4. **Modify `js/app.js`** to add interactivity to the page as per the project requirements.

## Development Strategy

### Plan

- Review the project rubric and requirements.
- Break down the project into small, manageable tasks.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Build the Navigation Menu**:
    - Dynamically create navigation items based on the sections present in the HTML.
    - Append these items to the navigation menu.

2. **Add Scroll Functionality**:
    - Implement smooth scrolling when a navigation item is clicked.
    - Use `scrollIntoView` for smooth scrolling behavior.

3. **Set Active Section**:
    - Highlight the section in the viewport and the corresponding navigation link.
    - Use `getBoundingClientRect` to determine the section's position relative to the viewport.

4. **Refactor Code**:
    - Ensure the code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.

### Additional Features

- **Scroll to Top Button**: Add a button that scrolls the page to the top when clicked.
- **Collapsible Sections**: Allow sections to be collapsible to improve page navigation.
