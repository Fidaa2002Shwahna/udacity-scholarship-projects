# Personal Blog README

Welcome to the Personal Blog project! This is a simple, responsive portfolio website designed to showcase personal projects and professional information.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main HTML pages:
1. **Home Page (index.html)**: Introduces the owner, provides contact links, and includes a personal photo.
2. **Blog Post Page (blog-post.html)**: Showcases previous projects for me with brief descriptions and links to live demos.


## Features

- **External Links**: Links to the owner's email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and blog posts.

## Technologies Used
